   Product Location is tracked by means of carrier's (Truck driver or Delivery persons) Mobile GPS service (An in-built IOT).

We have to only specify what are the products for the particular driver. So, the customers can live track their products which is same as the drivers location. When the product load is passed to the next driver, then the next driver's location is tracked for the products.
Thus, the products are tracked in a chained network in the realtime process.


## Software Required

*  A mobile application for the drivers (Product carriers)
      * Flutter
      * Dart

*  A web app for the customers
      * HTML
      * CSS
      * Javascript
      * JQuery
      
*  Backened Tool
      * Firebase

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How it works ?

Since the entire project is only a working model, the products ids are are already linked with the specific drivers.All you need to do is login to the website with login credentials (email : shalinisaravanan050@gmail.com and password : asdfghjkl ) and click track button.

You will be directed to the map page where you can see the live location of your package.

## Demo

* Visit our website [https://example.com](https://example.com)
    
## Advantages

* LOW COST
    Since inbuilt IOT is used, we need to charge only for the app development.
    
* LATENCY
    Since real time database is used, location is fast & accurate.

* SCALABITY
    Idea can further be extended in all means - Roadways, Railways, Waterways & Airways as well.

* UNIQUENESS
    No separate GPS are used instead mobile GPS is tracked.
