   Package location is tracked by means of carrier’s (Truck Driver or local Delivery person's) mobile GPS in a chained network as the Product ID  is embedded with driver’s GPS data in the database.

We should specify the packages and their unique ID's to the particular driver's GPS enabled Mobile App. The customers can track their packages in Real-Time by tracking the driver's location. Since the packages have unique ID's, When the package is shifted to the next driver, the new driver's location is tracked and the current driver's location is cut-off. Thus, the packages are tracked in a chained network in the Real-Time process.


## Software Required

*  A Mobile Application for the drivers ( Package carriers )
      * Flutter
      * Dart

*  A Web App for the customers ( Clients )
      * HTML
      * CSS
      
*  Backened Technologies
      * Firebase (Database)
      * Javascript
      * JQuery

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How it works ?

Since the entire project is a working model (Prototype), the package ID's are already linked with the specific driver's accounts. All you need to do is login to the website with login credentials (email : sample@gmail.com and password : sample ) and click track button of your products.

You will be directed to the map page, there you can see the live location of your package.

## Demo

## Advantages

* <b>Low Cost</b> - 
    Since inbuilt IOT (Mobile GPS) is used, we need to charge only for the app development.
    
* <b>High Latency</b> - 
    Since Real-Time database is used, location is fast & accurate.

* <b>Scalability</b> - 
    Idea can further be extended in all means - Roadways, Railways, Waterways & Airways as well.

* <b>Uniqueness</b> - 
    Mobile GPS is used for tracking instead of using separate GPS.
